## 🧠 Algorithm Explanation

Brief explanation of the algorithm used to solve the problem, why it was chosen, and how it satisfies the problem constraints efficiently.

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. **Step 1**: Describe the first key action in the algorithm (e.g., initialize pointers or variables).
2. **Step 2**: Describe the second step (e.g., iterate through both input lists).
3. **Step 3**: Describe the final step (e.g., attach the remaining nodes or return result).

## ✅ Constraints

- Constraint 1 (e.g. `0 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 50`)
- Constraint 2 (e.g. `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`)
- Constraint 3 (e.g. Lists are sorted in non-decreasing order)

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric            | Complexity |
|-------------------|------------|
| Time Complexity   | O(n + m)   |
| Space Complexity  | O(1)       |

Where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two input lists.
