## üß† Algorithm Explanation

This problem simulates the manual addition of two numbers represented as reversed singly-linked lists, digit by digit.

- Traverse both linked lists simultaneously.
- Add corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous step.
- Store the result as a new node in the output list.
- Carry over any value > 9 to the next digit.
- Continue until both lists and carry are exhausted.

The output is a new linked list that represents the sum, also in reverse order.

## ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(max(n, m))
  Where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two input lists. Each node is visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: O(max(n, m))
  A new node is created for each digit in the result list, which at most equals the longer of the two input lists (plus one if there's a carry).
