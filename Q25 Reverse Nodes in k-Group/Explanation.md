## üß† Algorithm Explanation

We are given the head of a linked list and an integer \( k \).
We reverse the nodes of the list \( k \) at a time and return the modified list.
If the number of nodes left at the end is less than \( k \), we leave them as they are.

We use an **iterative in-place reversal** because:
- It runs in \( O(N) \) time (optimal).
- It uses \( O(1) \) extra space (optimal).
- It modifies only the node pointers, not their values.

### ü™ú Steps

1. **Initialize a dummy node** pointing to the head. This helps simplify pointer operations at the head of the list.
2. **Iterate through the list in groups of \( k \)**:
   - Use a pointer to find the \( k^{th} \) node ahead of the current position.
   - If fewer than \( k \) nodes remain, stop.
3. **Reverse the \( k \) nodes**:
   - Use three pointers (`prev`, `curr`, `next`) to reverse the links of \( k \) nodes in-place.
4. **Reconnect the reversed group**:
   - Connect the previous group's end to the start of the reversed group.
   - Move the `group_prev` pointer to the end of the newly reversed group.
5. Continue until you reach the end of the list.

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- \( 1 \leq k \leq \text{length of linked list} \)
- The list contains at least one node.
- You **cannot change the values of the nodes**, only the pointers.

## ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

| Metric            | Complexity |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Time Complexity**   | \( O(N) \) ‚Äî each node is visited and rewired exactly once |
| **Space Complexity**  | \( O(1) \) ‚Äî only a few pointers are used, no extra data structures |
