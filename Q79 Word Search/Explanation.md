## üß† Algorithm Explanation

We solve this using **backtracking (DFS)**:

- Start DFS from any cell that matches the first letter of the word.  
- Move up, down, left, or right to continue matching letters.  
- Mark a cell as visited (temporarily change its value) to avoid reusing it in the same path.  
- Backtrack (restore the cell) after exploring.  
- Use **pruning optimizations**:  
  1. **Letter-count check** ‚Äî if the board has fewer instances of any character than the word requires, return `False`.  
  2. **Rarer-end search** ‚Äî reverse the word if its last character is rarer than the first to reduce branching.

### ü™ú Steps

1. **Pre-checks**: Count letters in the board vs. word ‚Üí prune impossible cases.  
2. **Optimize start**: Reverse the word if the last letter is rarer than the first.  
3. **DFS Search**:  
   - If the current cell does not match ‚Üí backtrack.  
   - If last letter matches ‚Üí success.  
   - Mark cell as visited and explore 4 neighbors.  
   - Restore cell before returning.  
4. **Return**: If any DFS path succeeds, return `True`; else return `False`.

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- Grid size: `m x n`, with `1 ‚â§ m, n`.  
- Word length ‚â• 1.  
- Moves allowed: up, down, left, right (no diagonals).  
- Each board cell may only be used once per search path.

## ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

| Metric            | Complexity                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Time Complexity   | \(O(R \cdot C \cdot 4^{L})\) |
| Space Complexity  | \(O(L)\) recursion stack     |

- \(R, C\): grid dimensions.  
- \(L\): word length.  
- Extra space is constant beyond recursion because we use in-place marking.
