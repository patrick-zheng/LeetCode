## üß† Algorithm Explanation

We compute the **Levenshtein distance** via dynamic programming.

Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum number of operations to convert `word1[:i]` into `word2[:j]`.

### Base cases

- `dp[0][j] = j` (insert all `j` characters of `word2[:j]` into the empty string)
- `dp[i][0] = i` (delete all `i` characters of `word1[:i]`)

### Transition

- If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`:  
  `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` (no additional cost)
- Else take the best among three operations:
  - **Insert** `word2[j-1]`: `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
  - **Delete** `word1[i-1]`: `dp[i-1][j] + 1`
  - **Replace** `word1[i-1]` with `word2[j-1]`: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`

This yields an `O(m¬∑n)` algorithm (where `m = len(word1)`, `n = len(word2)`).  
Space can be optimized to `O(min(m, n))` using a rolling 1D array that keeps only one row.

### ü™ú Steps

1. **Initialize** a DP array for the shorter string: `dp[j] = j` for `j = 0..n`.
2. **Iterate rows** for `i = 1..m`:
   - Set `dp[0] = i` (deleting `i` characters to reach empty).
   - Sweep `j = 1..n`, updating with:
     - If chars match: use previous diagonal.
     - Else: `1 + min(insert, delete, replace)`.
3. **Answer** is `dp[n]` (minimum edits to convert full `word1` to full `word2`).

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- `0 ‚â§ len(word1), len(word2) ‚â§ 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters
