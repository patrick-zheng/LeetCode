## üß† Algorithm Explanation

The inorder traversal of a binary tree visits nodes in the order:  
**Left ‚Üí Root ‚Üí Right**

We can solve this using either **recursion** or an **iterative approach with a stack**:

- **Recursive solution** is simple: visit the left child, then the current node, then the right child.
- **Iterative solution** simulates recursion using a stack: push nodes while going left, then pop, process the node, and move right.

Both ensure nodes are visited exactly once in the correct order.

### ü™ú Steps

1. Initialize an empty stack and result list.
2. Set a pointer to the root node.
3. While the pointer is not `None` or the stack is not empty:
   - Go as far left as possible, pushing nodes onto the stack.
   - Pop from the stack, add its value to the result.
   - Move to the right child.
4. Return the result list.
