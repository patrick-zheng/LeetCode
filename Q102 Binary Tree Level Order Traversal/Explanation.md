## üß† Algorithm Explanation

Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Maintain a queue to process nodes level by level. For each level, read the current queue size, pop exactly that many nodes, record their values, and push their non-null children. Append the collected values for each level to the answer.

### ü™ú Steps

1. **Initialize**: If `root` is `null`, return `[]`. Otherwise, push `root` into a queue and create an empty `result` list.
2. **Process a level**: Let `k = queue.length`. Create an empty `level` list. Repeat `k` times: pop a node, append its value to `level`, and enqueue its left/right children if present.
3. **Store & repeat**: Append `level` to `result`. Continue while the queue is not empty.

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- Tree can be empty.
- Node values can be any integers.
- Let `n` be the number of nodes; all nodes are visited at most once.
